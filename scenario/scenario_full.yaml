          Medium shot (MS), @Topa walking toward camera at eye-level.
          Slow dolly-out — camera gently pulls backward as @Topa walks toward it. Creates a floating, dreamy feeling. Very slow, lullaby pace.
          Transition to blue hour / early night. Cool blue ambient light overall with warm remnants of orange on the horizon. Stars appear as tiny warm practical lights — each star is a small glowing point adding sparkle. Fireflies emerge as moving warm yellow-green practical lights, gently illuminating @Topa's face in passing flickers. Soft blue key light from above (moonlight beginning). Warm fill from fireflies.
          Medium depth of field, 50mm lens. @Topa tack sharp. Fireflies in foreground are soft warm circles of bokeh floating through frame. Stars in background are tiny sharp points. Dreamy quality overall.
          The @Valley at night — the same valley from Scene 1 (same plants, same distant volcanoes, same river path), but now under a deep blue night sky. The environment is recognizably the same place — full circle from morning to night. Stars appear one by one — twinkling softly. Fireflies float up from the grass, glowing yellow-green. @Topa walks slowly toward his sleeping leaf, yawning mid-step. His eyes are half-closed. His steps are slow and sleepy.

        title: "Curling Up"
        camera: "Close-up (CU) on @Topa settling into sleep. Slightly high-angle — camera looking down tenderly, like a parent watching a child sleep. Very slow crane down combined with very slow push-in — camera gently descends and approaches @Topa as he curls up. Intimate, protective feeling. Almost imperceptible movement."
        focus: "Very shallow depth of field. Tack sharp focus on @Topa's face — his closed eyes, pink cheeks, peaceful smile. His tail that he hugs is slightly soft. Fireflies surrounding him are beautiful warm bokeh circles. The leaf beneath is soft. Extreme intimacy and tenderness through focus."
        audio: "Soft contented sigh. His breathing slows — gentle, rhythmic. Music box melody continues softly. A single firefly buzzes very close, then moves away."

          3D cartoon for toddlers, Pixar-style, soft rounded shapes, warm pastel colors, big expressive eyes.
          Same faces, proportions, colors. @Topa always bright-green, orange frill, brown eyes.

          Soft cool blue moonlight as key light from above and camera left. Warm yellow-green fill from surrounding fireflies — creates gentle warm accents on his green skin. Single soft white rim light from behind (moonlight edge). The big leaf he sleeps on has a faint warm green glow. All shadows are very soft — no darkness feels threatening.

          @Topa reaches his big soft leaf — the same leaf from Scene 1, Shot 2, in the same spot in the @Valley. He circles it once (like a puppy), then curls up into a ball. He wraps his tiny tail around himself and hugs it. His eyes slowly close. A peaceful, content smile spreads across his face. He lets out a tiny happy sigh and drifts to sleep.

        title: "The End"
        camera: "Start on medium shot of sleeping @Topa, then dolly-out to extreme wide shot (EWS) of the entire valley at night. Slow dolly-out combined with slow crane up — camera pulls back and rises simultaneously, revealing the full nighttime valley. The movement mirrors the opening shot of Scene 1 in reverse — bookending the film. Very smooth, 5-second continuous pullback."
        focus: "Start shallow depth of field on sleeping @Topa. As camera pulls back, depth of field progressively deepens until reaching deep focus at the extreme wide shot — the entire valley and starry sky are sharp. Fireflies transition from soft foreground bokeh to sharp midground dots as the depth changes. Final frame: everything in focus, peaceful panorama."
        audio: "Music box lullaby reaches its final gentle notes. All sounds slowly fade: crickets, water, breeze. Final music box note rings and slowly fades to silence. Last sound: one single distant firefly buzz, then silence."

          Full nighttime palette. Soft blue moonlight as overall ambient light. Hundreds of fireflies scattered across the valley as tiny warm practical lights. Stars fill the sky — bright but gentle. The moon (not shown directly) casts a soft silver key light from above. The sleeping leaf area has a slightly warmer glow than surroundings — a safe, cozy pocket of warm light in the blue night.

          Camera slowly reveals the @Valley at night — the SAME valley from Scene 1 Shot 1. Same plant arrangement, same volcano positions, same river path — but now bathed in soft blue moonlight instead of golden sunrise. This visual echo bookends the entire film. Hundreds of glowing fireflies drift like stars on earth, the sky full of twinkling stars. Sleeping @Topa becomes a tiny peaceful shape in the vast gentle landscape. Text gently fades in at center screen: "THE END" in soft white rounded letters with tiny animated stars twinkling around the text.
